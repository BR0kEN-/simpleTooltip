simpleTooltip
=============

**simpleTooltip** - analog or lite-version of [Tipsy Tooltip](https://github.com/jaz303/tipsy).

Most part of develop implemented on CSS, but role of controller perform a small JavaScript library.

Ð’enotation
-------
Why named a **simpleTooltip**?
- only **3 Kb** exhaustive code;
- works in most browsers;
- easy to use;
- compact and harmonious appearance;
- simple text prompts without additional functional;
- a JavaScript controller - is a library, which may be expanded by new plugins.

It seems to me, these items completely reveal the basic idea of develop - simplicity.

Usage
-------
Use of tooltip possible on any HTML element. To do this, you must assign couple attributes for element:
*data-hint* and *data-title*. Value of first attribute must be one of predefined words and it affects
on positioning of tooltip relative element which it's given. Context of second - text of tooltip without
any of formatting (text/plain).

Possible values for an attribute **data-hint** and their impact on shift:
- **nw** - Northwest;
- **north** - North;
- **ne** - Northeast;
- **west** - West;
- **east** - East;
- **sw** - Southwest;
- **south** - South;
- **se** - Southeast.

Why was used the JavaScript?
-------
Functions of plugin isn't numerous. Initially, performed checks positioning of all elements which have a
tooltip - it shouldn't be a static. For this reason, all non-conforming elements receive relative positioning.

Then, when you hover the mouse over an element, its width is calculated and if it not more than maximal and
tooltip don't directed to south or north, work of plugin will be stopped. Otherwise, the work will continue for
a few actions:
- width is greater maximal - tooltip gets value of maximum width and a special text formatting.
- directed on south or north - tooltip is aligned to center of element which it's assigned.
